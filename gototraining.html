                    GoToTraining Android app allows training attendees to attend live training from anywhere. As the design lead, I redesigned the app from February to June 2015.

                    Analyzing 6 interviews with the online training attendees, I discovered 4 themes that will encourage learning: asking questions, interacting with others, taking notes, and learning by doing. From site visits and interview with the trainer, <span class="content-highlight">engagement and interaction</span> are also the most important factors in determine if the training is successful.

                    As the redesign project scope doesn't include functionality changes, I chose 2 existing function to focus on - <span class="content-highlight">chat and hand raise</span>.

                    After trying out possible layouts and discussing with developers, I narrowed down the direction. All the secondary functions are hidden in a right side panel.

                <p>
                    I went further and started to think about how to make chat more prominent in the UI to encourage the usage.

                    <h6>The 2 floating button for chat and hand raise catch attention from the attendees. When in full screen, the buttons move to the corner to create an immersive viewing experience.</h6>

                    Combining the existing color palette and the material design guidelines, I created the visual theme for the app. During the visual exploration, I spent some time on the iconography, and made sure that the icon works for color blind as well.

                    Beside the navigation refresh, I also added small details here and there (for example, in the empty chat screen and onboarding) in the app to encourage chat and hand raise.
                </p>
                <h3 class="call-out">
                    There's significant improvement in the usage of chat and hand raise, comparing to metrics before.

                <p>
                    Of course, this is just our MVP to our redesign. There are many other improvements throughout the app that the team is still working on.
